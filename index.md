        <p class="signature">Game Programmer & AI Developer</p>
        <p>
            Hello! I'm a game programmer with an interest in AI systems and gameplay mechanics. 
            I have experience in both Unity and Unreal Engine, and really enjoy finding novel 
            solutions to complex technical problems. This has pushed me to always be looking at
            new technologies, as well as driving me into the games industry, where I hope to help
            develop cool systems to build believable and enjoyable world.

    <h2>About My Work</h2>
    <p>
        I've recently graduated from champlain college with a bachelors in Game Programming (with a math minor), 
        and while I haven't found a role within games, I'll be keeping my skills sharp by regularly adding new projects to here. 
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to my technical projects I'm currently working on expanding this site as well. I hope you take 
        a chance to check out my blog, read some technical articles for projects I'm working on, and connect with me on social media!
